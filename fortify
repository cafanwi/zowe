## What is Fortify SCA
Fortify Static Code Analyzer (SCA) is a powerful and widely used application security tool provided by Micro Focus  that is used to analyzes source code and pinpoints the root cause of security vulnerabilities.

Key features and capabilities of Fortify SCA include:

1. ***Ease with Integrating with Other Fortify Tools:*** Fortify SCA can be integrated with other tools in the Fortify suite, such as Fortify WebInspect (dynamic analysis) and Fortify Software Security Center (for centralized reporting and management).

2. ***Static Application Security Testing (SAST):*** Fortify analyzes and identifies security vulnerabilities, code quality issues, and compliance violations early in the software development lifecycle. 

3. ***Multi Language Support:*** Fortify SCA supports a wide range of programming languages and technologies' including Java, C/C++, .NET, JavaScript, Python, and more.

4. ***Extensive Rule Sets:*** Fortify SCA can detect various security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), buffer overflows, and many others. We can customize and create our own rules to align with our specific security requirements.

5. ***Integration with Out CICD GitLab Pipeline:*** Fortify SCA integrates will be integrated with our CICD pipeline to enables developers to run security scans directly from their development environment and automates scans as part of the CI/CD process.

6. ***Provides Detailed Reports:*** Fortify SCA generates detailed reports that highlight identified vulnerabilities and provide guidance on how to remediate them. 

7. ***Audit and Compliance:*** Fortify SCA is known to help with industry-specific compliance standards and best practices by identifying coding patterns that violate security guidelines and standards.

8. ***Allows for Customization and Configuration:*** Fortify SCA can be customized to align with our coding standards, policies, and security requirements. This includes configuring which rules are applied and defining custom rules.

9. ***Easy to Scalability:*** Fortify SCA can be used to scan both small and large codebases, making it suitable for projects of various sizes.

## Installation
Installing Fortify SCA (Static Code Analyzer) as a Docker image

***NOTE:***  
Fortify SCA (Static Code Analyzer) is a complex enterprise-level application that typically requires a more detailed installation process, including licensing and configuration. Since Fortify SCA is a proprietary tool, its installation may involve legal agreements, licenses, and access to Fortify's resources, which cannot be directly automated in a Dockerfile.

### About Downloading the Software
Fortify Static Code Analyzer and Applications is available as a downloadable application or package. For details on how to acquire the software and a license for the Fortify Software, see the Micro Focus Fortify Software System Requirements document.

### Fortify ScanCentral SAST (fortify-sast-scancentral.yml)
Perform a comprehensive Static Application Security Testing (SAST) assessment using your on-premises Fortify ScanCentral environment. The fortify-sast-scancentral.yml template uses the Fortify ScanCentral client to prepare a zip file of the project source code and dependencies and then  start a SAST scan in Fortify Software Security Center/ScanCentral using the prepared payload.
The invocation of the ScanCentral client should be modified to fit each individual project and CI/CD pipeline needs.  Please refer to the following resources for more information on customizing the template:

[ScanCentral documentation](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/fortify-software-security-center/) 

The template uses a Linux image and does not supoprt preparation of .NET, C/C++, and Swift/Objective-C technologies using ScanCentral. Fortify on-premises customers should utilize Fortify Static Code Analyzer (SCA) to integrate local translation and/or scanning on the GitLab runner.
