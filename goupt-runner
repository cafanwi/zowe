Create a group runner with a runner authentication token
Version history 
Prerequisites:

You must have the Owner role for the group.
You can create a group runner for your self-managed GitLab instance or for GitLab.com. When you create a runner, it is assigned a runner authentication token that you use to register it. The runner uses the token to authenticate with GitLab when it picks up jobs from the job queue.

To create a group runner:

On the left sidebar, select Search or go to and find your group.
Select Build > Runners.
Select New group runner.
Select the operating system where GitLab Runner is installed.
In the Tags section, in the Tags field, enter the job tags to specify jobs the runner can run. If there are no job tags for this runner, select Run untagged.
Optional. In the Runner description field, add a runner description that displays in GitLab.
Optional. In the Configuration section, add additional configurations.
Select Create runner.
Follow the on-screen instructions to register the runner from the command line. When prompted by the command line:
For the GitLab instance URL, use the URL for your GitLab instance. For example, if your project is hosted on gitlab.example.com/yourname/yourproject, your GitLab instance URL is https://gitlab.example.com.
For the executor, enter the type of executor. The executor is the environment where the runner executes the job.
